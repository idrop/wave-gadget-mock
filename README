mockwave.js is designed to mock some of google wave's functionality, modelling a wave's state and participants for instance.

It also mocks google's gadget api.

To use this library, first transform your wave.xml file into an equivilant html file. Then import jquery, json.js and mockwave.js into the html file.

This js file is dependent on jQuery for ajax gets, and to json.js for json marshalling.

It's still very rough around the edges, but hey, it works for me - I can do 'offline' google wave development.

Have fun,
Phil.
